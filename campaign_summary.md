## ðŸ§­ Campaign Summary (Sessions 1â€“16)

### **The Unraveling of the Walkers and the Portal Conflict**

The campaign begins with the party embroiled in a mysterious assault at the Blue Dragon Inn, where robed figures â€” later identified as *The Walkers* â€” initiate a violent confrontation. Cephas, Ravin, Oryn, Griffith, Aarrak, and others emerge as the central adventurers entangled in escalating conflicts tied to void energy, planar travel, and ancient magics.

Following the initial skirmish and interrogation of captured Walkers via *Rope Trick*, the party learns of Polydoraâ€™s abduction and a base located northeast of Braket. Pursuit leads the group to a hidden underground compound. After Griffith activates a magical portal with his obsidian sword, they descend into a glowing labyrinth of hallways, ancient coffins, and ominous runes. An impulsive act from Griffith awakens vampires, sparking a deadly confrontation. He briefly succumbs to their influence but is rescued through fire and flight.

### **Fragments and Pursuit Across Planes**

The party regroups and survives another vampire assault, this time with aid from Mel and Palyndir. With strategic use of magic, stealth, and combat, they secure the area and rescue Polydora, who is found chained atop a magical eye. Her extraction triggers further dimensional instability, culminating in the party being split during portal travel.

In a surreal side arc, Cephas, Ravin, and Ignara find themselves in an eerily familiar but technologically metallic dimension with an unknown second moon and a crater emitting strange energy. Disguises and illusion magic help them infiltrate the local population, but encounters with *Chronomancy-marked enforcers* and a narrow escape through a planar portal highlight the growing threat of time-warping forces.

### **Alliances, Revelations, and the Rise of Greater Powers**

Back on their original plane, the party connects with a shadowy alliance of strategists led by Phillip the Wise. They are tasked with investigating deeper incursions by the Walkers and their manipulations of planar gateways. They ride a magitek tram to a deserted zone where strange anomalies suggest a collision of realities â€” including a ghostly bard named Percival and a town half-swapped with another dimension.

Further delves lead them into party halls hosted by Eladrin and guarded by Dwarves, where the rogue fairy dragon Gittlemox plays both ally and menace. Strange runes, enchanted items, and social engineering blend with increasing tension as the partyâ€™s presence begins to draw attention. Redcaps â€” sinister fae enforcers â€” identify someone among the party as a target, but do not engageâ€¦ yet.

That evening, two **Femoras** â€” massive magical beings â€” storm the gathering. A brutal battle leaves many injured, but the party triumphs. They seek escape but are rerouted by boat through a massive aquatic tunnel system. There, they find an isolated dock and a combat encounter with unknown local threats.

### **The Final Descent and the Portal Battle**

The trail leads underground once more â€” deeper into the temple, where they find Griffith missing and signs of his struggle. In a climactic chamber, they engage a warlock, a wyvern, and a drake. Despite being scattered and nearly destroyed, diplomacy from Ignara and Gittlemox saves them from the wyvernâ€™s wrath. Gittlemox proves an unlikely savior, sealing a volatile portal just as it activates.

The final battle with the warlocks reveals more questions than answers. A mysterious man appears, recognized by Polydora and Palyndir, only to be healed by an angelic being. The angel confirms their delayed intervention and warns that although the party stalled the ritual, something still came through â€” and the true threat may yet lie ahead.

We met Palandir the wood elf who has been tracking the voids and is aware of some stuff in desert. Does not volunteer tons of info. There were some shaking/vibrating quakelike things. We diverted to Ceanatha where Cephas stole a magical book and then we met some seafaring folks and talked our way onto a boat.

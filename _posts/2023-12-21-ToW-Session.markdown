- We begin immediately after defeating the sand worm. Oren uses his defender to rip a tooth from the worm. Akkarrk floats down to the sand. The water dragon has been travelling invisibly with the party, but her concentration ends and she appears with us. Oren repairs his automaton. We then short rest.
- When we awake, some strange shimmering is occurring. Looks like waves of heat but not quite. This was more like sparkling in this distance and slowly approaching us. Oren dons his goggles and sees cosmic booms and flashes in all directions; concentric circles reverberating around us. Clearly a lot of magic. It comes upon us. The shimmering fades and then we're suddenly in a blizzard.
- Claus bounds into view and asks us who we are and how we came to be here. It becomes clear that we're in a new realm. We hop onto his sleigh. The sleigh is filled with contraptions. A team of snowdeer are hitched to the sleigh who begin to run and almost immediately they begin to fly. 
- We learn that we're now in the far north of the fae wilds. Oren continues to tinker and gives his goggles to Claus for the duration of the trip. He pulls out some kind of expanding workshop full of tools and proceeds to work on the goggles. He takes the goggles apart with astounding speed. He quickly interprets the design and creates a schematic. He gives a copy of the schematic to Oren.
- Detect magic reveals a multitude of magical items. Claus warns Cephas not to steal anything.
- We arrive in a small village where the sleigh comes to a stop. Claus says that we need to go indoors and discuss how to get home because we shouldn't stay long. He also alludes to some sort of assistance he needs from us.
- We walk into a garage type area in the bath of large building where pixies are swirling and appear to be weaving some larger piece of fabric. Claus sits down in a large chair and we begin to discuss - he snaps his fingers and noises from outside the house vanish. 
- Mrs. Mab Claus brings us food. Then they both leave for a while. Akkarrk eats a ton of sweets. Oren tries to turn something into the magical quilt. 
- Eventually Mab comes back and gives us additional tasks to complete when we return to our own world. She has an issue with some mages operating in the Parvet Desert. She gives an obsidian stone to Akkarrk and tells her that it will tell her what she needs to know when we return to our realm. The Mab leaves.
- Claus returns, sends us to our quarters and we long rest.
- The next morning he sends us in search a mystical steed. It's coat is purplish and blueish with shimmers on its legs. It is not to be confused with a unicorn.
- Claus walks over to the wall and presses the wall. It morphs into a giant fireplace with tendrils of flames that separate and between them a walkway leads to an arch.
- We walk through and find ourselves in a deep forest with sparse snow. We follow the magical compass that Claus gave to Oren.
- We find a frenzy of footprints, some humanoid, some hooved, we follow a trail of hooves and blood.

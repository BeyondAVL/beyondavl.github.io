# Session Log
6. After finishing the attack against the robed militants, we tied them up and Ravin used Rope Trick. Ravin and Oryn dragged both soldiers into the extradimensional space for interrogation. We learned their names are "The Walkers" and that they have many bases. Polydora has been captured and taken to a specific base — matching the location seen in Cephas's scrying. The soldier who gave up the base's location said it was northeast of Braket, on the way to Sienetha. A party member had already been there — later revealed to be Oryn. The Walkers have been tracking him, but we don’t know why. The base is underground, but we don’t know how deep or where Polydora is inside. We completed questioning, and Oryn took both brooches.

While Oryn and Ravin were distracted, one soldier Fey Stepped out of their bonds, escaping the extradimensional space. As they fell toward the alleyway walkway, the soldier opened a portal in the ground and vanished through it before Griffith could grab them.

Ravin dragged a barrel into the Rope Trick space, and we stuffed the unconscious soldier inside for extra security. Then we fled to the stables and rented horses. Ravin picked up his dragon scale shield just in time from the smithy, then regrouped.

We traveled to the base that Oryn had visited before. As we were discussing how to enter, Griffith struck the ground with his obsidian sword, triggering a portal that transported us — fortunately — to an empty courtyard. We descended a staircase to a subterranean level.

The hallways were lit by an ambient glow from the walls. Facing three directions, we explored left first — small, empty rooms with magical runes on coffin-like containers. Aarrak recognized only one word: FIRE. We moved to the opposite direction and found a room with a table and four chairs — covered in entrails of mixed freshness. No sign of where bodies were taken. Suddenly, we realized Griffith was gone.

He had returned to the coffin room and pried one open, releasing a vampire who politely thanked him. It ran to another coffin, which Griffith helped open. The vampires turned hostile — focusing on Griffith. Still, he ran to a third coffin. Ravin urged him to stop. Oryn cast grease at the door, Aarrak prepared defenses, and Ravin stood ready to seal the room. One vampire charged, and Ravin used Fey Step to inflict fear.

The others fled for the stairway. Ravin slammed the door, trapping Griffith and the vampires inside. Oryn (with Spider Climb) cast Firebolt, igniting the door and grease. Griffith came to his senses, tumbled through the flames, and escaped with burns. A vampire, still frightened, attempted to follow but retreated through the fire, taking heavy damage. The other pursued and attacked.

Griffith retreated, and the party sought escape — heading toward the safety of sunlight...

# Session Log
- We collect ourselves and head toward Ceanatha. As we arrive a couple of hours later, we notice copious machinery being hauled into the city on carts.
- Ravin moves ahead of the group and tries to sneak into the outskirts of town to scout.
- Everything seeming clear, we head to the Red Dragon Inn. We board our horses at the stable and Oryn heads off to an apothecary with Ravin and Cephas. Mel tends to Griffith and Polydora. 
- We reach the apothecary and Oryn barters for a strong healing potion. The apothecary brews a potion for Oryn and we head out of the shop and make our way back to the inn. 
- The others head upstairs and Cephas stays in the lobby scrying the party. Oryn gives Polydora the strong healing potion. Polydora eventually comes to. Oryn asks about the "water, stone, speech" clue. Apparently, we should have asked the Galeb. Polydora reveals that she has some gaps in her memory and we don't get many answers from Polydora. Eventually we select guards and are able to sleep through the night.
- When we awaken, Oryn briefly discusses next steps with Polydora. We seek out breakfast and bring some up to Polydora. Cephas asks Polydora to identify the sigils he's learned, and she tells him that he can create a portal to the Temple of Corellon. Cephas briefly explains to the group then proceeds to createa portal and go through. After a few more words of explanation from Polydora, the others join as well.

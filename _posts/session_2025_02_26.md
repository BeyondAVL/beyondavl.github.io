# Session Log
14. Unsure how to ascend the 80-foot drop they descended earlier, the party follows Gittlemox’s guidance and heads two tunnels left of the original hallway. They arrive in a massive chamber and realize they are aboard a large, anchored boat.

Investigating the three deck rooms, Ravin triggers a trap in the third room — disguised bookshelves release water rapidly. Gittlemox recommends hiding in the first room, where they previously survived the same trap. Before entering, Aarrak scouts the cavern ceiling and spots sealed metal doors, similar to other exits encountered. Unable to bypass them, the party locks themselves in the first room, which proves watertight.

During their enforced rest, Gittlemox shares some magical spoils:
- Aarrak receives an amulet.
- Cephas receives a robe.
- Ignara receives a staff.

Eventually, the boat lurches into motion, waking the party. They hear water draining and walk onto the deck to find themselves atop a vast body of water with no visible shore.

The boat accelerates, speeding across the surface. After some time, it docks in a lagoon-like structure, clearly engineered for the vessel. From further along the dock, a commotion draws their attention. The party disembarks and investigates — finding a group of locals confronting a large creature. The encounter turns violent, drawing the party into an unexpected battle.

# Session Log
15. After a short rest, the group proceeds down the temple hallway from which their recent attackers came. They reach a dead-end with three doors — right, left, and center. While attempting to investigate, part of the hallway collapses. The party rushes through the door on the right, passing through a series of rooms and stairs, ultimately reaching their residential quarters.

There, they discover Griffith is missing. However, his sword and remnants of his gauntlets are found shoved into tears in the mattress.

The party finds another room with its doors partially ajar. Mel asks Gittlemox to scout ahead, but he refuses. Cephas goes instead, turning invisible. Inside, he finds Polydora and Palyndir lying prone, while a caster channels a spell toward them, accompanied by a wyvern and a drake. Cephas relays the scene via a scrying message to Oryn, who shares it with the others.

Before the group enters, Cephas charms both the drake and the wyvern. The witch maintains their spell on the downed allies and later casts a Fear spell, affecting most of the party. Only two resist the magical fear.

Eventually, the witch and drake are defeated. The ancient wyvern, now uncharmed, retreats to a corner and breathes fire — knocking out the entire party except for Ignara and Gittlemox. Through their efforts and pleas, they convince the wyvern to disengage. Gittlemox revives Polydora, who then heals the rest of the group.

# Session Log
12. The group continues their journey into town, accompanied by Gittlemox, the mischievous fairy dragon. After some persuasion, Gittlemox agrees to guide us to a place where food might be found. We arrive at a peculiar location with a glowing, rune-covered door 30 feet above ground.

Aarrak flies up and reads the runes while Gittlemox encourages us to “use our hands.” Doing so opens the door, revealing a chamber with an 80-foot drop and no stairs. Cephas casts a portal to safely lower the party down.

Inside, we discover a massive underground space with eight tunnels stretching in different directions. Using Hunter’s Mark to track Gittlemox, the group picks one tunnel and follows. Faint voices echo ahead. Rounding a corner, we come upon a grand ballroom where Eladrin Elves are socializing.

Cephas disguises himself as a dwarf to blend in with other dwarven servers hosting the event. Ravin also alters his attire to fit the formal atmosphere. Cephas roams the room detecting magic, identifying enchanted hats, rings, and knives with evocation and transmutation properties. Ravin patrols the edge of the gathering.

Meanwhile, Gittlemox flutters over to the party members at the room’s threshold — Aarrak, Mel, and Oryn. Ravin rejoins the group. The conversation with Gittlemox is whimsical but not particularly revealing; they enjoy stealing shiny objects and are barred from entering this place.

Mel and Ravin challenge Gittlemox to prove their skills by stealing a magic item for Mel — in exchange for allowing the fairy dragon access to the underground.

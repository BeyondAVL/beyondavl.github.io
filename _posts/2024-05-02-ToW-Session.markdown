# Session Log
- We begin by sending to Polydora and then heading to Northu via Bracket.
- We arrive at the Blue Dragon Inn at Northu near dusk and head inside to ask about Polydora. The inn is sparse, there are some travellers along with a band of dwarves, and one barkeep behind the counter. It's a quiet night.
- We inquire at the bar about Polydora and Bjorn, order some drinks, and Griffith asks more questions. Oren begins to play bagpipes and Cephas hoodwinks the barkeep into paying Oren for his performance.
- The automaton server arrives and Oren is immediately enthralled.
- Cephas scries Polydora and sees that she's still travelling, so he heads upstairs to bed. Oren and Griffith stay downstairs as the bar empties.
- Eventually we all go to rest and in the morning we return to the common area.
- The barkeep calls Cephas up and stealthily slips him a tiny scroll along with some coins.
- Cephas notices a sort of familiar elf at the other end of the bar and approaches him. It turns out to be Palandir.
- Cephas suggests that Palandir tell him who he's meeting. The Palandir asks Cephas to take a walk. Oren and Griffith tail them. Noticing this, Palandir goes behind the building and pulls out a black sheet which he throws on the ground. He asks Cephas to step onto it and he does, immediately falling in. Palandir follows. Oren and Griffith rush to follow as well. They both make it in, but Griffith is injured in the process.
- We land in a field with very odd, hazy, colorless surroundings. Palandir tells us that Polydora and Bjorn have been intercepted and we urgently need to help them. Unfortunately, we're stuck in what appears to be in another plane.
- We work for a little while to try to find a way to return to the material plane, but then begin to walk in a random direction.
- After we walk for a moment, two creatures wreathed in shadow fly toward us. !INITIATIVE!
    - After a long battle we defeat them leaving a pile of bones and dust.

# Session Log
- We arrive at the Temple of Correlon. [Revise: "that's where the teleportation circle brought you. But when you went and looked back in, there was nothing in the room. It's just empty. And you haven't seen anyone coming or going, but somebody peeked into 1 of these other rooms last time. And then over here was sort of like a library area with just some folks who are in there having conversations from the day beforeIt's off map. But yeah, you all are able to, like, go to mess home and get some food if you want, and then venture out further or whatever else is on the docket."]
- We follow Polydora out of the room and find ourselves in a larger chamber filled with other smaller chambers, a row of tables lining the middle of the room. Then we proceed through to another chamber filled with small tables and walls lined with bookshelves. Polydora speaks with those gathered there and fills them in on recent events. As the others talk, Cephas wanders around looking at books on the shelves while Ravin gauges the room. Cephas asks for books related to ancient illusion magics.
- Next we find our sleeping quarters. Cephas bunks alone while Oryn and Griffith bunk together. Mel and Aaakakakaka also bunk separately. Polydora and Palandir bunk together.
- Polydora rushes off to other business in the temple. Oryn interogates Palandir to find a way out of the temple into the city. Palandir agrees to guide us out of the temple. [Add description of city.]
- As we are exiting, some guards halt us and give us a code phrase to re-enter the Temple: "Strawberry Pickle."
When you look right, you sort of see like what looks like like just a lot of really, really smaller ish, but still nice residential buildings. So yeah, those are kind of the two things that are within your vantage now. And then really in the far distance, you can see like a city gate down there that is currently closed. That's the sense that you're getting when you look over just based on what you've seen in smaller towns as well.
- We investigate the shops and find ourselves at the door of a magical items shop. We enter and it is immediately apparent that an explosion has occurred. Ravin speaks with the shop keeper while Oryn goes about fixing things in the rubble. Afterward, we barter with the shopkeeper.
- Outside the shops we encounter some Walkers who question us. Eventually Cephas pulls a black bear from his bag of tricks, mounts it, and chargers at the walkers. As he does so, he lifts a finger, pointing at a walker, and immediately the Walker crumples. The Walker then rises as a zombie and joins the group as we return to the Temple.
- The Temple guards bluster about our additional companion but eventually grant us entrance, we return to our rooms, and pass the night.

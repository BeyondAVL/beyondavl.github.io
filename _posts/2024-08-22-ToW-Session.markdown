# Session Log
- We arrive at the Temple of Correlon. [Describe later].
- We follow Polydora out of the room and find ourselves in a larger chamber filled with other smaller chambers, a row of tables lining the middle of the room. Then we proceed through to another chamber filled with small tables and walls lined with bookshelves. Polydora speaks with those gathered there and fills them in on recent events. As the others talk, Cephas wanders around looking at books on the shelves while Ravin gauges the room. Cephas asks for books related to ancient illusion magics.
- Next we find our sleeping quarters. Cephas bunks alone while Oryn and Griffith bunk together. Mel and Aaakakakaka also bunk separately. Polydora and Palandir bunk together.
- Polydora rushes off to other business in the temple. Oryn interogates Palandir to find a way out of the temple into the city. Palandir agrees to guide us out of the temple. [Add description.]
- As we are exiting, some guards halt us and give us a code phrase to re-enter the Temple: "Strawberry Pickle."
When you look right, you sort of see like what looks like like just a lot of really, really smaller ish, but still nice residential buildings. So yeah, those are kind of the two things that are within your vantage now. And then really in the far distance, you can see like a city gate down there that is currently closed. That's the sense that you're getting when you look over just based on what you've seen in smaller towns as well.
- We investigate the shops and find ourselves at the door of a magical items shop. We enter and it is immediately apparent that an explosion has occurred. Ravin speaks with the shop keeper while Oryn goes about fixing things in the rubble. Afterward, we barter with the shopkeeper.
- Eventually we decide to go speak with the elder council.

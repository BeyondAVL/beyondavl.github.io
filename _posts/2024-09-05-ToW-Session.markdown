# Session Log
- When we arise in the morning we return to town, zombie in tow, to retreive Ravin's armor. We arrive early in the morning, Ravin collects his armor and Mel haggles over dragons' teeth. The party disperses amongst the shops. Cephas heads to the used book store while Mel, Ravin, and Oryn visit the weaponsmith and armorer.
- Cephas offloads the Tome of the Stilled Tongue. Mel obtains a new set of very cool armor with bits of dragon scale mixed with leather and other materials.
- We return to the temple and locate Polydora in the great hall preparing for a meeting with the elders. Oryn enters the great hall with the intention of joining the meeting.
- Guards prevent our entry initially but Polydora motions for us to join the meeting. As we enter the room someone approaches Cephas and asks that the zombie remain outside. It becomes clear that our magics aren't operating properly in this room.
- The meeting is called to order. The speaker thanks the group for gathering and acknowledges disturbances in the world. He wants to discuss a few particular disturbances including vibrations and worms in the Parvet Desert and the voids appearing in rivers. Beyond the Tarkan Desert, other odd occurrences are being reported. The Delroth Walkers have been identified in all of these places and the power seems to be growing. Oryn interjects to share that he has firsthand experience with these. The Delroth Walkers are reported as practicing chronomancy. Next, Polydora shares about her period of captivity, her work with Palandir, and the tasks that she has delegated to the party. Palandir shares about the sand worms and invites the party to share their experiences. The party fills in the gaps in the stories reported thus far. Parts of our story seem to stir those gathered. Specifically, the elements with vampires, planeshifting, and chronomancy. Polydora confirms our story.  We learn that the region has a deep history with vampire who were mages lured by the dark arts. They became permanently tainted by these magics and sought control over reality. Some 700 years ago, they tried to overthrow the rulers of the land. They also tried to force a collision of planes to amplify necromantic powers on this plane. They suspect the some of the vampires from that period may have survived and lain dormant until now. There is chance that the vampires we encountered stem from the original four.
- Mel inquires about methods to stop the vampiric process and the speaker refers us to assistance.
- Some believe the river voids may be remnant portals to the Fae Wild, a land ruled by Queen Maab. Some of the Fae aided in the war against the vampires: Aerdeth and Theirestra. Those two, if still alive, may be willing to aid us once more. 
- Finally, the meeting adjourns.

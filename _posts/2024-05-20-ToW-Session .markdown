# Session Log
- Back in our bodies, we turn to see a fire-breathing dragon with tendrils of smoke seeping from its mouth. !INITIATIVE!
    - As the dragon approaches, we ready ourselves to face it.
    - After a few seconds, a baby dragon emerges from a crag.
    - Cephas blinks away to take shelter.
    - The dragon's frightful presence terrifies Cephas, Oren, and Griffith.
    - The party peppers the dragon with a few attacks before it lands.
    - Finally, it lands in front of Oren and Griffith spewing acid breath wounding them and destroying T061.
    - After a short battle, Palandir fires an arrow of banishing and strikes the dragon. It vanishes and Palandir shouts for the party to run.
    - Most of us do, but Oren, enraged, turns on the baby dragon.
    - The adult dragon reappears and we begin to battle it again while retreating to the tunnel.
    - Palandir continues to deal the bulk of the damage.
    - The dragon spews more acid at the party in the tunnel, felling Mel and Griffith.
    - Cephas finally hits the dragon with magic missiles which shatter its eye and bring it down.
    - The party then turns on the baby dragon.
    - Pageturn throws his bow to the ground and begins to mutter, casting eldritch blast.
    - We battle a while longer with Oren and Ravin healing party members.
    - Eventually Griffith fells the baby dragon. Initiative ends.

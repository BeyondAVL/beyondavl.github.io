# Session Log
- The group, aside from Oren, spends 2 days in confinement. Meanwhile Oren explores and then tries to search for the group.
    - He explores one chamber with large metal parts and another area with a large terrarium/garden. In the chamber with the terrarium there is a large temperature change toward the end of the corridor. Down the third corridor he finds another room with a spiral and another corridor with a row of doors lining it. He tries to open the doors but fails. The next day he tries to activate the elevator with Toby. He is unsuccessful. Eventually he tries to attract attention with his bagpipes. He is unsuccessful.
- On the third day Oren wakes to find the elevator descending.
- Meanwhile, the group awakens to find someone waiting at their chamber door. The one-armed dragonborn person enters the chamber.

# Session Log
- The group, aside from Oren, spends 2 days in confinement. Meanwhile Oren explores and then tries to search for the group.
- He explores one chamber with large metal parts and another area with a large terrarium/garden. In the chamber with the terrarium there is a large temperature change toward the end of the corridor. Down the third corridor he finds another room with a spiral and another corridor with a row of doors lining it. He tries to open the doors but fails. The next day he tries to activate the elevator with Toby. He is unsuccessful. Eventually he tries to attract attention with his bagpipes. He is unsuccessful.
- On the third day Oren wakes to find the elevator descending.
- Meanwhile, the group awakens to find someone waiting at their chamber door. The one-armed dragonborn person enters the chamber. 
- We manage to convince him we were sent by a dying warlock.
- Cephas uses his crystal ball to scry Oren and sees him banging on the elevator. He then tries to scry the dragonborn, but fails.
- Mel, trying to discern the capabilities of the knife, manages to maybe cut the air. She has a sudden realization of the potential of the item.
- The elevator reaches Oren and four guards step out.
- Oren surrenders and the take him and Toby into the elevator. 
- As Oren approaches the cell, the door opens and Cephas slips out. He uses trickery and illusion to convince the guards that they were needed elsewhere. The group escapes the cell and runs to the elevator. First they go down and glimpse their captors before proceeding to the top and escaping under cover of Mel's magic.
- We head north through the desert toward Caenatha. We walk into the evening and through the night and reach the outskirts of town near dawn.
- Walking through town we notice that crystal tech is more pervasive. We find a tavern and buy food and drinks.
- Oren walks off to find a smith. Mel eats and drinks. Cephas gets a room. Eventually Mel gets a room as well. Griffith goes to find Oren, but is stopped before he can leave the tavern.

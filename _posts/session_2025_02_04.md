# Session Log
13. The evening resumes with the party observing an underground gathering of Eladrin Elves, hosted by gnomes. Gittlemox is encouraged to steal magical items, but before that can unfold, Ravin spots four Redcaps entering the ballroom. Though they don’t attack, they patrol the room, clearly observing the attendees. The crowd responds with quiet unease, stepping aside to let them pass.

Ravin alerts the rest of the group to their presence and history. The Redcaps split into pairs; one pair approaches the hallway entrance where the party is positioned. Ravin steps into view while Oryn, Aarrak, and Mel retreat. One Redcap sniffs Ravin closely but says nothing and eventually reunites with the others.

Cephas, embedded deeper in the crowd, overhears the Redcaps confirming their target is present — though no name is shared. After they leave, Cephas retrieves Ravin and the two rejoin the others.

As the party retreats through the tunnel, a loud commotion erupts in the ballroom. Using his scrying stone, Cephas reveals that two enormous magical creatures, identified by Ravin as Femoras, have entered. Panic overtakes the crowd. Ravin expresses confusion, stating he doesn’t know why they are here or if he is the one they’re after. Cephas studies him but detects no deceit.

The group prepares for battle near the 80-foot descent point. The Femoras deal significant damage and incapacitate several members, but the party prevails. After stabilizing the wounded, they are left with a pressing question: what do they do next?

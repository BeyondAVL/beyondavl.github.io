# Session Log
- We try to enter the central column of the room which has four equally spaced doors. We succeed by pushing all four doors at once.
- Mel tries to enter but is repelled by a harsh force.
- In the center of this chamber, beyond a ring of water and a ring of fire is green crystalline sphere embedded in a stone altar.
- We each touch the crystal and hum. The doors close and we sense that we are moving, descending.
- We reach the bottom of chute and exit the chamber by touching the doors and humming.
- Here we find a chamber lit by crystalline light. Plants are growing. We manage to open the outer chamber doors by touching and humming.
- While we are here, four individuals pass by, collect some samples from vegetation. They nearly spot us but go their own way.
- We explore a hallway until we come to a T-junction. At the junction, Cephas becomes invisible and explores the area. While he is away, three individuals ferret the rest of the party out of the hallway into a chamber with a spiral floor. Cephas finds himself on the other side of the hall separated from the party.
- The thre individuals head to the library. Cephas follows them. They rummage through several books and tear out some pages which they fold and pocket. As this is occurring, Oren, Griffit, and Mel explore a closet full of trinkets and a workbench.
- The individuals leave the library and Cephas melts back into the corner of the hallway. Unfortunately he is spotted.
- INITIATIVE!
- Cephas runs back to the party taking a swipe along the way. Mel fires a crossbow at one of the guards and connects. However, we quickly see that we are outmatched. Oren seals himself inside the closet and the rest of the party is captured.

# Session Log
We begin just after escaping the dungeon, traveling back toward the tram with the sorcerer in tow. As we depart the town where we met Percival, Ravin senses a strange, unnatural feeling — the only one among us to do so. The sensation fades as we move farther from the area.

We travel until nightfall and make camp under tree cover. During the night, orcs attack, along with a large, unidentified boar-like creature. The group awakens and engages in battle. After dispatching the enemies, we restrain the sorcerer again and finish resting.

In the morning, we hear industrial sounds from a distant encampment. The noise is faint and does not present an immediate concern. Ravin uses magic to speak with nearby animals, finding only birds. They confirm that other humanoid-like beings are present near the sound source, but offer no additional insight — though food scarcity is noted.

The group decides not to investigate and resumes the journey, reaching the tram and boarding it for the return to the council.

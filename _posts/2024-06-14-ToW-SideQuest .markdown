# Session Log
- Cephas and Ravin meet outside an apothecary in Northu and become acquainted. After a while we hear rumors of strange activity outside of town near the river. We decide to walk down and investigate.
- There are some signs of a scuffle near the river's edge.
- Ravin wades into the river and prods with a stick until he finds something solid. Together, we pry it off and reveal a portal in the riverbed. Ravin pokes into it with his stick until something grabs it and pulls it through. We scramble onto the river bank.
- Suddenly several veggiepygmies run up behind us with spears. INITIATIVE!
    - Ravin fells two of them immediately.
    - Cephas notices something emerging from the portal and scutters away from the river failing to charm the entity.
    - Several more veggiepygmies run toward us and face the figure emerging from the portal.
    - Finally, the figure emerges from the portal, cloaked, holding a tome.
    - He disperses a gray mist which causes those inside to fall into a slumber.
    - Cephas dons the helm of brilliance and casts wall of fire into the mist where the figure stands.
    - Ravin misty steps behind him and strikes him. The mist disperses.
    - The cloak falls aside and a spider emerges.
    - Ravin slashes again and the spider is felled.
    - Initiative ends.
The veggiepygmies replace the cap of the hole.

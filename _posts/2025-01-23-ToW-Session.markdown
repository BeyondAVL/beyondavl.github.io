# Session Log
11. **Side Quest:** After defeating a monster, the party steps through Mel’s portal, but Cephas, Ignara, and Ravin find themselves in a different dimension, separated from the others.

The sky shows a second, unfamiliar moon alongside the one they recognize. The world resembles Calbrexi — same climate and topography — but the nearby city is metallic and alien in construction. As they approach, it seems uninhabited, with no visible wear or signs of life. They find a 500ft crater radiating heat and light. When Cephas tests the edge, it burns his foot. Soon after, a PA system announces the start of the day.

Cephas, invisible, knocks on a door and observes a confused resident leave for work. He enters and lets the others in after learning how to open the door. Inside, they change into citizen clothes. Ravin casts Hunter’s Mark to track Cephas as they follow a crowd to a government district.

They arrive at the Agriculture building. Cephas, ahead and invisible, passes through a checkpoint. Ravin and Ignara are stopped; their claim to be new citizens is rejected, as no new citizens exist. Enforcers attempt to remove them, but Ravin uses Dust of Disappearance to escape with Ignara. Reunited, Cephas and Ravin disguise themselves as guards while Ignara remains invisible.

Cephas fabricates an illusion of the fugitives and sends guards after them. Ravin bluffs his way to the exit, requesting access to greet backup forces. Before they can leave, the support team arrives and disrupts Ravin’s illusion, prompting combat.

During the fight, an enforcer reveals a necklace bearing the Chronomancy symbol. An unknown individual suddenly grabs Cephas, teleports to Ravin and Ignara, and opens a portal. The three escape and are deposited back with the main party as if no time had passed — returning from their bizarre detour through a strange dimension.

# Session Log
- We begin having just returned from the fae wild. Mrs. Mab Claus offers to answer 3 questions for the party. Cephas elects to owe Mab a favor in exchange for two additional questions. We ask:
1. Is Griffith being followed? A: Not many others of similar sentience in the desert.
2. What is the best path to follow to reach the Delroth Walkers? A: Follow the path you have been on. There is not a path through this desert, but if you continue to follow the shimmers, you'll find your way there.
3. How do we protect ourselves from the Delroth Walkers? A: Chronomancers are difficult to deal with but you may find some tools to aid you. Hints toward crystal technologies or like an item that Griffith collected. 
4. Cephas asks two secret questions.
5. Answers will be sent to Cephas in a dream within 3 days.
- Oren asks for another boon in exchange for a favor. In exchange for assistance in crafting a device, he will receive the schematic. He is handed a schematic and a wax-sealed bundle.
- Griffith asks for information in exchange for a potential future favor.
- We break down camp after Mab vanishes and follow a shimmer that Oren spotted (east-north-east) toward the center of desert.
- A tent-like structure comes into view. When we're about 30 feet away, we see that there is an opening in the earth.
- As Mel and Aaak approach they see a very steep staircase that quickly drops out of view.
- Cephas enters the staircase and cannot see its terminus.
- Mel pulls out a torch. Cephas walks further ahead and sees that the staircase is narrowing. Finally, it levels out and opens up into a round atrium.
- In the center of the atrium is a massive cylinder. There are several sets of double doors around the room. 
- Cephas casts silent image in the form of Polydora. She enters the room and when she does two figures come out from around the pillar. INITIATIVE!
- A create stabs through the image of Polydora. Oren begins to attack, the others rush into the room.
- Battle ensues. We fell one of the warlocks, but the other escapes.

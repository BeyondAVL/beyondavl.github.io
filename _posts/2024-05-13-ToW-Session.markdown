# Session Log
- We begin walking in the same direction through the plane of shadows when Palandir's pack suddenly begins to writhe and we see a figure emerge from the sheet, clearly a ranger upon further inspection. We learn that his name is Ravin and he was following Mel when he fell through the sheet.
- We then realize another figure has appeared in our group. Its face is cloaked in black and it mimicks our speech. We decide to walk away from this entity, unnerved. 
- As we are walking the landscape begins to shift quickly and we find ourselves in a different climate. Ravin notices that the world seems to be decaying. There is very little life aside from some bioluminescent mycelium. 
- We continue on to the town. Frank, the cloaked figure, scurries ahead of us into one of the buildings. 
- We follow frank to the building and Ravin opens the door. He enters the room and four figures at a table turn at once to look at him. One of them has an uncloaked face and he sees that their faces are in the form of a crow. He exits the building closing the door behind him, but one of the figures, presumably Frank, follows him out where he meets the group.
- After much discussion with the figure, we discover its name is Etcher. Finally, we discover we can ask it "yes" or "no" questions. Etcher is very excited about his sword and shield.
- Etcher points the direction toward someone who can help us leave this plane and he accompanies us toward a mountain. After climbing for a while, we ecounter a series of caves cut in the side of the mountain.
- We enter an opening between two boulders and begin to descend into one of the caves. 
- In an inner chamber, we find another crow-figure named Pageturn. He tells us we must travel to the peaks to access greater magics. There we may use the sheet portal once more, or use astral projection to return home. Cephas steals one of his magical books.
- We proceed to the peaks where we find an alcove which we approach. We take seats around the spread-out sheet and find ourselves projecting into the astral plane, tethered to our bodies by a silvery thread.
- After a while, we hear wingbeats from an approaching dragon. We reenter our bodies and prepare to fight.

# Session Log
- We feel some shaking on the cart on the return trip. When the door opens, we see that the trees to the south have been scorched.
- Cephas scries Polydora who appears under Calbrexi admidst a battle.
- Ravin and Ignara piece together that Calbrexi was rebuilt on top of an ancient temple that sank into the ground centuries ago.
- We approach the city and begin to search for the catacombs.
- Several statues are outside the gate, Oryn scales the wall and squeeze through a gap in the gate. As he does, the statues are magically illuminated with sigils representing schools of magic. One sigil is the symbol of the Dusk Weavers. Cephas touches the statue and it disappears into the earth revealing a staircase. Cephas begins to descend, Mel holding him back.
- The group descends the spiral staircase for several minutes until the path begins to flatten out leading us to a bridge that extends out into space.
- After the party investigates for a while, Cephas decides to jump. As he does, the bridge animates behind him becoming a slide that the others use to reach the water below.
- Something snaps and the party is in a different place. It is massive and cavernous and we are all dry.
- As we approach the altar a menacing creature appears. INITIATIVE!
- During the battle we eventually find that the creature's only vulnerability is fire.
- Cephas is cursed and suffers additional points of exhaustion daily. He has 6 days to break the curse or become a thrall.

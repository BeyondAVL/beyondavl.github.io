# Session Log
- We discuss options with Pageturn who is distracted by the dragon corpses. 
- Eventually, Ravin convinces him to focus and he goes with Cephas to retrieve a book from his workshop.
- Cephas takes a few additional hidden books and follows Pageturn to the peak.
- It turns out that one of the books is a scroll crafting book and Cephas begins to study it.
- Mel and Oryn cut open the dragon which draws horror from Pageturn. He informs them the dragon is male and won't carry any eggs. Palandir becomes aware of the danger of a female dragon returning to the nest. He unrolls the sheet and jumps through. The party scrambles to jump through as well and return to the plane from which we came.
- We find ourselves in a different place, somewhere near the rift wall.
- Cephas scries Polydora and sees her struggling to remain conscious, strapped to an altar, in a medium-sized cavernous room similar to the chambers of the Parvet desert fortress, but cruder.
- Cephas uses sending to communicate with her and get information about her plight. She replied with "the walkers, under cover, beware, please help."
- We head into Braket and see cloaked city guards everywhere. The have a magical gold fastener for their cloaks with a radiant sun emblem.   
- We go into the Blue Dragon Inn and the bartender greets us.
- Cephas questions him discreetly about the presence of the guards.
- Oryn pops out of the inn to speak with a guard, then returns and replicates his brooch.
- Oryn and Ravin decide to explore the shops. Cephas disappears. Mel remains at the inn.
- Oryn and Ravin find a blacksmith and begin haggling to sell dragon scales and obtain some dragon scale equipment.

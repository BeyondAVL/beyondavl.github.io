- On the boat waiting for repairs to set sail. Corralled and asked to do chores. Lots of variety of people traveling on the ship recruited from various places. Some in fancy attire seeking passage. 
- Massive dinner in mess cabin with passengars and 25ish sailors. Detect magic cast reveals some sailors have magical rings or amulets; crystal smith and magictech (sp?) engineer have tons of magic; several different schools of magic that are peculiar and difficult to distinguish.
- On deck reading, hearing metal clinking together which disrupts reading. Meet Oren on the deck. He's an autognome with no memory beyond the past year. Return to cabins, Mel sleeps on deck. 
- Wake up and ship has gone pretty far out to sea. We recall that the areas closer to shore are somewhat dangerous so it makes sense that the ship is skirting that area. We don't see any of the creatures. Breakfast conversation is around folklore re these creatures. Stories appear embellished. 
- After an hour or so, we start to approach the coast toward a less imposing inlet between cliffs. Boat stops off shore and a crew member finds us and let's us know this is our opportunity to disembark via rowboat. We decide to disembark with our supplies.
- On the beach Oren bargains for goggles of detection. We decide to walk into the desert. We notice nothing.
- Eventually we see what might be small shimmering flying creatures in the distance. 
- We set up a tarp to shelter and rest and SUDDENLY we see a giant white bird floating through the sky. It then fades out of vision a bit early.
    - Then SUDDENLY (FOR REAL THIS TIME) a giant sand worm appears !INITIATIVE!
        - It swallowed Mel!
        - Oren used firebolts, Mel swung sword, Cephas used a wave and magic missiles.

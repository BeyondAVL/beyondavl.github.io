## Earlier in Ceanatha... 
- Mel and Cephas wake up and feel drawn into the city center. The city is just waking up, we see some folks sleeping in the street.
- We eventually find ourselves in the industrial district of the town where smithing and other trades are present. There is some ore processing and some kind of temple nearby.
- We go looking for shops to pilfer and find ourselves involuntarily invisible. Mel touches a set of enchanted armor and is pushed away by some force.
- We begin to feel pulses of a desire to leave the town. They come and go with different strengths. 
- We enter another shop cluttered with trinkets and artifacts. We rifle through drawers, Mel steals a dull dagger made of stone. Cephas uses illusion magic to steal a crystal ball from two entranced individuals. The ball seems to draw people in, so Cephas only touches it with his cloak and don't look into it. We continue to feel pulses and decide to visit the apothecary.
- At the apothecary, Cephas uses illusion magic to manifest a form and purchase a vial of resistance potion. As he tries to take it strong psychic magic forces his hand away and breaks his concentration. He vanishes. Mel picks up the vial and they each drink some.
- Armed with some resistance, they decide to seek the source of the psychic lure.
- We follow the pull out of the town via a trail and follow the trail for some distance before the lure pulls us off of the trail headed due east onto the plains.
- Eventually we arrive at the mouth of a cave. Upon entering, we find a monk sitting atop a boulder. Cephas, seeing into the ethereal realm, sees the manifestation of a dragon superimposed with his image.
- It is clear that he has been watching us for some time. He invites us to join him in his work - the weaving of realities.
